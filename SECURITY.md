## Security Policy

### Reporting a vulnerability

Please do not open a public issue for security-sensitive reports.

Instead, report privately:

- Create a private advisory if this repo is hosted on GitHub, or
- Email the maintainer listed in the repository description.

Include:

- What you found and why it matters
- Steps to reproduce
- Suggested fix (if you have one)

### Scope

This project automates provisioning and hardening of a Proxmox LXC and installs MoltBot.
If you believe the automation could expose credentials, open ports, or weaken hardening, treat it as security-sensitive.
